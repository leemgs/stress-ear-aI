# AJA Submission Readiness Checklist — STARS (v0.9)

Cross-checked against the *American Journal of Audiology* (AJA) / ASHA journals
author requirements. AJA is an ASHA journal: submissions go through the ASHA
online submission system, use **APA 7th-edition** style, and undergo
**masked (double-anonymized) peer review**.

> **Verify before submitting.** ASHA updates its author instructions
> periodically. Treat every "⚠️ verify" item below as *check the current AJA
> "Instructions for Authors" page and submission portal*, not as a settled fact.
> Items are marked ✅ present / ⚠️ needs attention / ❌ missing.

## 0. Article type — decide first (⚠️ highest-priority item)

The manuscript is now framed as a **Research Article (survey-weighted public-data
analysis) reported against a prespecified analysis plan**, leading with the
primary KNHANES symptom-versus-threshold finding; the cross-national validation
and AI/safety components are clearly demoted to a **prospective companion**
(design only, no results). Before formatting anything else, confirm with the
editorial office **which AJA article category this fits** (e.g., Research Article,
Clinical Focus). The cover letter asks the editor for guidance on category —
good. This single decision drives the word limits, abstract format, and structure
below.

---

## 1. Manuscript structure & formatting

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Title page with full title, running head, all authors + affiliations | ✅ | In `main.tex`; running head "STARS / Stress, Tinnitus, and Hearing Outcomes". |
| **Masked ("blinded") manuscript** for review | ✅ | A standalone `title_page.tex` plus the `\ifblind` toggle suppresses the author block, corresponding-author/CRediT identities, and repository URLs. The current body has no unguarded author or institutional identifiers and no identity-revealing self-citations. Re-run the masking audit after revisions. |
| Double-spaced, 12 pt | ✅ | `\doublespacing`, `12pt` class option. |
| Continuous line numbers | ✅ | `lineno` package active. |
| Page numbers | ✅ | `fancyhdr` centered footer. |
| Title-page article-type / word-count block | ✅ | Present, but see word counts below. |

## 2. Abstract & keywords

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Structured abstract | ✅ | Purpose / Method / Results / Conclusions headings present. |
| Abstract word limit | ✅ | Abstract has been tightened to approximately 250 words, including its structured headings. Verify the portal's automated count at upload. |
| Keywords | ✅ | Six focused keywords. |

## 3. References (APA 7th edition)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **APA 7 reference style** | ✅ | **Converted** to APA 7 (alphabetical, `&`, italic journal+volume, DOIs as https links) and **full author lists filled for all "et al." entries** from the sources. The `hoffman` placeholder was replaced with the verified 2017 JAMA Otolaryngol paper (key → `hoffman2017declining`). See `REVIEW_NOTES.md §1.4`. |
| In-text citations resolve | ✅ | All 17 `\citep` keys have matching entries; no orphan citations, no uncited entries (audited in `REVIEW_NOTES.md`). |
| Every reference cited & every citation referenced | ✅ | 17 cited ↔ 17 listed, verified. |
| Complete bibliographic data (vol/issue/pages/DOI) | ✅ | All entries completed: `chakrabarty2024depression`, `mahboubi2013noise` (issue/DOI added), and the `hoffman` placeholder replaced with a verified 2017 source. See `REVIEW_NOTES.md §1`. |

## 4. Tables & figures

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| All tables cited in text, in order | ✅ | 6 tables — `tab:datasets`, `tab:variables`, `tab:harmonization`, `tab:results` (NHANES), `tab:results_knhanes` (KNHANES primary), `tab:results_knhanes_extended` (extended/sensitivity) — all cited in text. The former AI-components table (`tab:ai`) moved to the SAFE-EAR companion (`../paper02/`) with the two-paper split and is no longer part of Paper A. |
| All figures cited in text | ✅ | 2 figures — `fig:framework` (conceptual framework) and `fig:dag` (causal DAG) — both cited in text. |
| Table titles / figure captions self-contained | ✅ | Captions define abbreviations and the "synthetic ≠ result" caveat. |
| Figures legible / vector | ✅ | Both figures are TikZ (vector, scale cleanly). ⚠️ verify AJA's figure file-format/resolution rules if they require separate uploaded figure files rather than inline. |

## 5. Required disclosures & statements

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Disclosure of Financial & Nonfinancial Relationships** | ✅ | Conflicts + funding declared. ⚠️ ASHA has a *specific* disclosure format/field in the portal — enter it there too, not only in the PDF. |
| Author contributions (CRediT) | ✅ | Present in Declarations. |
| Ethics / IRB statement | ✅ | Public deidentified data (Stages 1–2); Stage-3 IRB at Ajou. |
| Data availability | ✅ | KNHANES (KDCA access), NHANES (CDC), code repo. |
| Code availability | ✅ | GitHub repo stated. |
| **AI-use disclosure** | ✅ | Generative-AI drafting disclosed; model roles constrained. ASHA requires AI-use disclosure — good that it is explicit. |
| Reporting-guideline checklists (STROBE / TRIPOD+AI / SPIRIT) | ✅ | Filled **STROBE** and **TRIPOD+AI** checklists created in `paper/checklists/`, each item mapped to the manuscript section addressing it. Upload as supplements. SPIRIT applies only to the future Stage-3 clinical trial. |
| ORCID for each author | ✅ | Sole-author ORCID 0000-0003-1845-7132 is present in the cover letter and title page; enter it in the portal metadata too. |

## 6. Cover letter

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Cover letter present | ✅ | `cover_letter.md` — strong; asks editor for article-category guidance. |
| Bracketed placeholders filled | ✅ | Date and ORCID are filled; the generic “Dear Editor” salutation avoids an unnecessary editor-name placeholder. |
| Originality / not-under-review statement | ✅ | Included. |
| Suggested reviewers | ✅ | No placeholder remains in the letter; supply names only if the submission portal requests them. |

## 7. Consistency (see `REVIEW_NOTES.md` for detail)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| NHANES results in abstract = results = table = JSON | ✅ | All prevalence/OR/CI values match `code/outputs/nhanes_results.json` exactly. |
| **NHANES cycle window stated consistently** | ✅ | **Reconciled to 2017–2018** in `methods.tex` and `study_config.yaml` to match the committed results. See `REVIEW_NOTES.md §3.1`. |
| **KNHANES cycle window stated consistently** | ✅ | **Narrowed to 2010–2012 (KNHANES V)** across protocol text, config, and tables to match the mapping/CLI. See `REVIEW_NOTES.md §3.2`. |

## Pre-submission action list (ordered)

1. **Confirm the AJA article category** with the editorial office (drives everything else). *(author — editorial office)*
