# TRIPOD+AI Checklist — SAFE-EAR (companion paper B)

Reporting checklist for the AI/extraction + deterministic-safety component,
following the TRIPOD+AI statement (Collins et al., 2024). This checklist covers
the **realized** content of the SAFE-EAR paper (`../main.tex`): a deterministic,
guideline-derived red-flag safety layer over schema-constrained clinical-text
extraction, evaluated on an open 71-case benchmark with two reproducible
rule-based extractors and an executed MedGemma-4B comparison.

> **Scope note.** The two research *risk-stratification prediction models*
> (tinnitus presence; audiometric hearing loss, with AUROC/AUPRC/calibration)
> that appeared in the original combined protocol are **prospective** and are not
> reported in either the empirical STARS paper (`../../paper/`, STROBE) or this
> benchmark paper; the corresponding rows below are marked **[Prospective]**.
> The **realized** subject here is the deterministic red-flag layer + rule-based
> extraction benchmark, whose evaluation plan is prespecified and whose metrics
> are computed on an open, no-patient-data benchmark.

> **Governance.** The extractor is a *research* tool with a declared intended
> use — never a screening, diagnostic, or triage device. A deterministic
> red-flag layer overrides any probabilistic output and cannot be suppressed by a
> low predicted risk, and extracted red-flag features are clinician-verified
> before use (`../main.tex` §"System architecture", §"Governance").

| 8 | Sample size rationale | ◑ | Curated 71-case benchmark; Wilson 95% CIs reported; harness supports arbitrary N; `../main.tex` §"Limitations" |
| 9 | Missing data handling | ✅ | Complete synthetic cases; extractor handles absent/implicit cues (colloquial/ambiguous categories); `../main.tex` §"Reproducible extraction baseline" |
| 10 | Preprocessing; leakage prevention | ✅ | Deterministic rule-based extraction; gold urgency assigned **independently** of the rule code; `../main.tex` §"Two-level evaluation" |
| 11 | Model type / architecture and rationale | ✅ | Deterministic rule layer over a schema-constrained extractor (extraction → non-overridable safety floor); `../main.tex` §"System architecture" |
